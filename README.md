# Blocklists for Adguard Home, uBlock Origin and PiHole

Blocklist of analytics and annoyances found by my own research. Blocks:
- Stats and analytics (including privacy preserving ones) 
- Lotttery
- Data collection 
- Bug trackers
- Ads
- Data brokers
- Font content delivery networks
- Consent/cookie managment platforms


## Adguard Home
Add this domain to Adguard Home:
```
https://gitlab.com/ph00lt0/blocklists/-/raw/master/blocklist.txt
```


## uBlock Origin 
uBlock Origin does not seem to work with Gitlab's raw file for some vague reason. You can add;
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ph00lt0/blocklists/master/blocklist.txt
```


## PiHole
For PiHole there is a different blocklist, containing the same domains prefixed with '0.0.0.0' as localhost
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ph00lt0/blocklists/master/pihole-blocklist.txt
```
